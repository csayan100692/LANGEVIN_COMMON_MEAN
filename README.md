# LANGNBT
LANGNBT is the R package for testing the common mean direction mu_0 of several Langevin populations.Install this package in Rstudio by using the command install.packages("LANGNBT").Import this package by using library(LANGNBT).This package contains 3 functions "NBT3", "NBT4" and "NBT5".NBT3 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of three sample Langevin populations.NBT4 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of four sample Langevin populations.NBT5 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of five sample Langevin populations we have to give two inputs for running the above three functions. First input is the data matrix which contains a set of matrices where each matrix is a random sample of size n from a Langevin distribution of dimension 3.Second input is the significance level these functions give two outputs, test statistic and critical value if test statistic value is less than the critical value then we fail to reject the hypothesis of common mean directions among the Langevin populations.
