# FvMLtest
FvMLtest is the R package for testing the common mean direction mu_0 of several FvML populations.Install this package in Rstudio by using the command install.packages("LANGNBT").Import this package by using library(LANGNBT).This package contains 12 functions "NBT3", "NBT4" and "NBT5", "PMT3", "PMT4", "PMT5", "HEUA3", "HEUA4", "HEUA5", "HEUB3", "HEUB4" and "HEUB5". NBT3 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of three sample Langevin populations.NBT4 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of four sample Langevin populations.NBT5 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of five sample Langevin populations we have to give two inputs for running the above three functions. 
PMT3 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of three sample Langevin populations.PMT4 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of four sample Langevin populations.PMT5 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of five sample Langevin populations we have to give two inputs for running the above three functions. HEUA3 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of three sample Langevin populations.HEUA4 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of four sample Langevin populations.HEUA5 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of five sample Langevin populations. HEUB3 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of three sample Langevin populations.HEUB4 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of four sample Langevin populations.HEUB5 computes the test statistic value and critical value of a given data matrix of five sample Langevin populations.First input is the data matrix which contains a set of matrices where each matrix is a random sample of size n from a Langevin distribution of dimension 3.Second input is the significance level these functions give two outputs, test statistic and critical value if test statistic value is less than the critical value then we fail to reject the hypothesis of common mean directions among the Langevin populations.
